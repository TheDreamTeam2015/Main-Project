# CS18010 Group Project

The group project is to provide a presentation based on the pros and cons of different code repositories in terms of teamwork and accessibility for a coding project. In this repository we have put a simple piece of code to print a greeting, as part of the greater attempt to test out the website and understand how such repositorys work.
